# Sudoku Solver CLI

A simple command-line-application sudoku solver created with C++ that utilizes [backtracking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/) algorithms to determine the available grid positions. 


## Motivation

This was one of my first college C++ projects, intended to practice my understanding of backtracking and constraint satisfaction problems. 


## Usage 

Provide a board array, then run the application directly in the command line with your compiler of choice to determine the puzzle solution.
